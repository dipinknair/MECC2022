									<h1>Submission Types </h1>
									<dl>The MECC 2022 submission website on PaperCept accepts multiple different types
										of submissions.
										Please see the descriptions of these submission types below. <dl>
											&nbsp

											<dl>
												<dt><strong>1. Contributed papers </strong></dt>
												<ol>
													A contributed paper is intended to be a self-contained, full
													description of completed work
													(i.e., not an extended abstract). All contributed papers will be
													peer reviewed. Contributed
													papers that are accepted for inclusion in the conference proceedings
													will be assigned to
													different conference sessions based on their topics.
												</ol>
											</dl>

											<dl>
												<dt><strong>2. Invited sessions/papers </strong></dt>
												<ol>
													<strong>Invited session proposals</strong>
													<br>An invited session proposal is a brief document that presents a
													unified theme bringing together up to
													6 invited papers into a cohesive session. The proposal should list
													the proposed invited papers
													(titles and abstracts at a minimum), and explain how they come
													together to form a cohesive topic
													of interest to the community. All invited session proposals will be
													peer reviewed.
													Upon submission of an invited session proposal, a session code will
													be generated by PaperCept.
													Authors must use this session code to link their invited papers to
													the corresponding invited
													session proposal. If an invited session proposal is accepted, then
													all of the corresponding
													invited papers that receive an acceptance decision will be assigned
													to the accepted invited session.
													If fewer than 6 papers submitted under the invited session code are
													accepted, additional papers may
													be assigned to the invited session if they are relevant to the
													session’s topic. If an invited session
													proposal is rejected, then any accepted invited papers linked to the
													invited session proposal will be
													assigned to other sessions.
												</ol>
												<ol>
													<strong>Invited papers</strong>
													<br>Invited papers are linked to an invited session proposal upon
													their submission.
													As with contributed papers, an invited paper is intended to be a
													self-contained, full
													description of completed work. A unified peer review process will be
													used for both
													contributed and invited papers. However, if an invited paper is
													accepted for inclusion
													in the conference proceedings and the associated invited session
													proposal is also accepted,
													the paper will automatically be assigned to the corresponding
													invited session.
												</ol>
											</dl>

											<dl>
												<dt><strong>3. Frontier sessions/papers </strong></dt>
												<ol>
													<strong>Frontier session proposals</strong>
													<br>A frontier session is similar to an invited session in the sense
													that it should bring
													together up to 6 papers to discuss a cohesive topic of interest to
													the community. In addition,
													the topic of a frontier session should represent an emerging
													frontier of research and discovery,
													e.g., a genuinely new area of research of interest to the MECC 2022
													community. Just like an
													invited session proposal, a frontier session proposal should list
													the proposed session papers
													(titles and abstracts at a minimum), and explain how they come
													together to form a cohesive topic
													of interest to the community. In addition, the frontier session
													proposal must explain the novelty
													of the proposed session’s research topic. All frontier session
													proposals will be peer reviewed.
													Upon submission of a frontier session proposal, a session code will
													be generated by PaperCept.
													Authors must use this session code to link their papers to the
													corresponding frontier session proposal.
													If a frontier session proposal is accepted, then all of the
													corresponding frontier papers that
													receive an acceptance decision will be assigned to the accepted
													frontier session. Moreover,
													if fewer than 6 papers submitted under the frontier session code are
													accepted, additional papers
													may be assigned to the frontier session if they are relevant to the
													session’s topic.
													If a frontier session proposal is rejected, then any accepted papers
													linked to the frontier
													session proposal will be assigned to other sessions, potentially in
													the form of an invited session.
													Finally, the conference’s organizing and program committees may
													choose, based on the outcomes of
													the peer review process, to re-designate a contributed or invited
													session as a frontier session if the
													topic of the session is deemed sufficiently novel and timely.
												</ol>
												<ol>
													<strong>Frontier papers</strong>
													<br>Frontier papers are linked to a frontier session proposal upon
													their submission.
													As with contributed and invited papers, a frontier paper is intended
													to be a self-contained,
													full description of completed work. A unified peer review process
													will be used for contributed,
													invited, and frontier session papers. If a frontier session paper is
													accepted for inclusion
													in the conference proceedings and the associated frontier session
													proposal is also accepted,
													the paper will automatically be assigned to the corresponding
													frontier session.
												</ol>

												<dt><strong>4. Workshops </strong></dt>
												<ol>
													<strong>Workshop proposals</strong>
													<br>A workshop is a pre-conference event, either half-day or full
													day,
													that introduces its audience to a cohesive topic of relevance to
													MECC 2022.
													A workshop can cover either a well-established topic or an
													emerging/frontier
													topic of interest to the MECC community. Moreover, a workshop can
													cover a scientific
													research topic or a topic of broad societal impact relevant to the
													MECC community.
													A workshop proposal should list the proposed workshop presentations
													(titles and presenters
													at a minimum), and explain how they come together to form a cohesive

													the total session time not to exceed 2 hours.
													Collaborations with industry are encouraged. Every talk at a MECC
													2022 tutorial session will be advertised on the MECC
													website. To this end, for every talk at a MECC 2022 tutorial
													session, the conference organizers expect the speaker(s)
													to upload a document listing: their names/affiliations, the title of
													their talk, and a an
													abstract (no more than 250 words) of this talk. Every tutorial
													session proposal, when uploaded to PaperCept, will generate
													a tutorial session code. The speakers at the tutorial session are
													asked to upload abstracts of their talks to PaperCept, and
													link these abstracts to the corresponding tutorial session code. A
													tutorial paper is optional and may be up to 12 pages
													long if submitted, subject to peer review.
