									<h1><strong>
										THE AMERICAN AUTOMATIC CONTROL COUNCIL
										</h1></strong>
											<p>The Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC) is organized under the auspices of the American Automatic Control Council (AACC), which is an association of nine professional societies:
											</p>
												<dl>
													<ol>â€¢ American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)</ol>
													<ol>â€¢ American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)</ol>
													<ol>â€¢ American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)</ol>
													<ol>â€¢ American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)</ol>
													<ol>â€¢ Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</ol>
													<ol>â€¢ Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences Applied Probability Society (INFORMS APS)</ol>
													<ol>â€¢ International Society of Automation (ISA)</ol>
													<ol>â€¢ Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)</ol>
													<ol>â€¢ Society for Modeling and Simulation International (SCS)</ol>
													
											    </dl>
									<p>AACC represents the United States to the global control community and supports the mission of the individual member societies in enhancing the role and contributions of automation for the benefit of humankind. AACC is also the US National Member Organization (NMO) of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC), a multinational federation of NMOs, each representing the engineering and scientific societies concerned with automatic control in its country. AACC helps arrange for IFAC events in the U.S. and provides delegates for IFAC committees and leadership.

										<br><br>The MECC was recently created under the AACC sponsorship and guidance (co-sponsored by IFAC). AACC also supports control education from K-12 through post-graduate studies. AACC provides opportunities for personal and professional development and recognition to its large cast of volunteers, on whom it is crucially dependent for its operations and success. The activities of the AACC are governed by a Board of Directors. Each AACC member society appoints a director. Operational responsibilities for the AACC rest with five officers, who report to the Board. All directors, officers, and committee members are volunteers. To learn more about AACC please visit www.a2c2.org.

										<h1><strong>
											International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)
											</h1></strong>
												<p>Founded in Paris in 1957, IFAC is the worldwide organization tasked with promoting the science and technology of automatic control in all systems, whether for example, engineering, physical, biological, social or economic, in both theory and application. IFAC is also concerned with the impact of control technology on society. Maintaining the highest technical level of scientific excellence is a major concern for IFAC. This is achieved through the technical excellence of our conferences, publications and technical committees, and excellence in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of our secretariat and administrative systems and processes. Besides various conferences it (co-)sponsors, IFAC is well known through the editorship of eight prestigious archival journals: Automatica, Control Engineering Practice, Annual Reviews of Control, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Journal of Process Control, Mechatronics, Nonlinear Analysis: Hybrid Systems, and IFAC Journal of Systems and Control, which are known as IFAC Journals and published in partnership with the official IFAC publisher, Elsevier.</p>
