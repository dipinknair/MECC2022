								<p><strong>Toward Lifelong Safety of Autonomous Systems in Uncertain and Interactive
										Environments</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Changliu Liu</strong>, Carnegie Mellon University
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									The research objective of this project is to study the design principles to achieve
									optimal lifelong safety of autonomous robotic systems in uncertain and interactive
									environments (UIEs). For example, this capability will enable industrial
									collaborative robots to safely and optimally work with unfamiliar human workers in
									novel tasks throughout the robots' lifetime. The safety requirements are represented
									as constraints on the choices of the autonomous systems to achieve their tasks. Our
									goal is to optimally augment existing systems (existing hardware platforms with
									task-oriented controllers) with advanced cross-task safe guardians that will monitor
									and modify the nominal task-oriented actions. The optimality refers to 1) optimal
									task performance when safety is assured; 2) optimal actions before inevitable
									failures, i.e., detect these inevitable failures as early as possible and inform
									users; and 3) optimal actions after any failure, i.e., never make the same mistake
									again. To achieve lifelong safety, we will equip the cross-task safe guardian with
									continual learning to track the time-varying dynamics of the UIEs and adaptive safe
									control to adjust the control strategy according to newly learned dynamic models. To
									achieve optimality in lifelong safety, we will equip the safe guardians with a
									cross-platform intelligent optimizer that can automatically optimize the safe
									guardians and account for inevitable failures. The optimizer will enable knowledge
									sharing for all guardians to learn from others' successes and mistakes.

								<p><strong>Functional Monolithic Holograms for Ultrasonics</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Shima Shahab</strong>, Virginia Tech
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									The use of ultrasonic holograms to generate complex volumetric pressure patterns
									from single-element planer transducers is a game-changing approach with nearly
									limitless possibilities. This approach is particularly useful in applications where
									an arbitrary acoustic field must be formed and the acoustic waves must pass through
									various regions with non-homogeneous qualities. A few examples include ultrasound
									medical treatment, contactless energy transfer, and particle manipulation. We
									present the acousto-elastic dynamics of low- to high-intensity monolithic holograms
									for the formation of complex spatially distributed ultrasonic fields. We will cover
									a wide range of topics, from fundamental theoretical investigation to high-impact
									implementations, by (1) focusing on the acoustic wave propagation and guiding
									mechanisms in various acoustic holograms; (2) identifying the nonlinear effects in
									acoustic holograms that can successfully represent the system dynamics under low to
									high-intensity acoustic fields; (3) validating the developed acousto-elastic models
									for hologram designs; (4) exploiting the fundamentally new physical phenomena in
									acoustic holograms. Our findings will enable frequency selectivity, wavefront
									shaping and control, and the engineering of nonlinear response features related to
									acoustic holographic lenses in multi-functional high-fidelity operations.

								<p><strong>Bridging the Gap between Safety and Real-Time Performance in Receding-Horizon
										Trajectory Design for Mobile Robots</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Ramanarayan Vasudevan</strong>, University of Michigan
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Autonomous systems offer the promise of providing greater safety and performance in
									the healthcare setting. However, this positive impact will only be achieved if the
									underlying algorithms that control such systems can be certified to behave robustly
									despite model uncertainty. This talk describes a technique called Reachability-based
									Trajectory Design, which constructs a parameterized representation of the forward
									reachable set that it then uses in concert with predictions to enable real-time,
									certified, collision checking. This approach, which is guaranteed to generate
									not-at-fault behavior, is demonstrated across a variety of different real-world
									platforms including manipulators, prosthetics, and walking robots.

								<p><strong>Augmenting the Aw-Rascle-Zhang Traffic Flow Model with a Distributed Energy
										Equation </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Stephanie Stockar</strong>, The Ohio State University
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Traffic congestion has a significant impact on travel time, idling, and
									transportation energy demand. Controlling vehicles using boundary control (via
									ramp-metering) or in-domain control (via platooning) has been explored to reduce
									traffic jams, traffic density, and travel time. However, the objectives of these
									control problems don’t explicitly include fleet energy. Unlike car-following
									(microscopic) models that calculate the forces acting against each individual
									vehicle and evaluate the energy at the wheel via the road load equation, there is no
									description of energy use in macroscopic models. Therefore, an extension of models
									based on partial differential equations (PDEs) that includes a distributed energy
									equation is needed. We postulate that, by formulating an energy minimization problem
									using a macroscopic traffic model with a distributed energy equation, it is possible
									to develop strategies for controlling traffic flow and inter-vehicle speed that not
									only reduce traffic jams, but also minimize energy usage all while being less
									computationally intensive over large stretches of road compared to a microscopic
									approach. This talk will present the derivation of a distributed road load equation
									that characterizes the energy usage along a stretch of road. The Aw-Rascle-Zhang
									model, which is a system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations, is
									augmented using the energy equation and the results are compared against the
									Improved Intelligent Driver Model and the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). The
									contribution of this work is a distributed, macroscopic description of energy usage
									that can be used for the formulation of energy minimization starting from a PDE.

								<p><strong>Modeling and Control of Cardiovascular System </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Yuncheng Du</strong>, Clarkson University
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot sufficiently pump blood to sustain
									the life. Over 6.5 million Americans have HF and about 0.88 million are newly
									diagnosed every year. Roughly, 10 percent of HF patients progress to end-stage HF
									when conventional drug treatments become ineffective and heart transplant becomes
									the best therapy. Since the need for donor hearts far exceeds their availability,
									alternative therapies to increase the heart’s pumping force are of keen interest. In
									one therapy, a pump, a ventricular assist device (VAD), is implanted into the
									thoracic cavity to assist with blood circulation. However, challenges exist for the
									broad application of VAD in clinics. Personalized hemodynamic modeling of the heart
									managed by a VAD plays an important role to predict therapeutic outcomes and improve
									treatment, but the complexity of cardiovascular system and variability among
									patients introduce significant challenges to provide accurate model predictions. In
									addition, the efficiency of current VAD is limited, as the operation of the pump is
									set at a constant speed, which cannot compensate for physiologic differences in
									patients or physiologic changes for the same patient over time. In this talk, I will
									discuss some of our recent efforts to address these challenges; examples include the
									development of a model to consider the effect of baroreflex regulation on the
									cardiovascular-VAD system and the design of a model-free adaptive controller to
									adjust the operation of the VAD with easily measured quantities of the pump.
									Following that, an overview of our current work will be discussed at the end.

								<p><strong>Dynamic & Control-Based Approach to Cellular Mechanotransduction
										Investigation</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Juan Ren</strong>, Iowa State University
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Mechanotransduction–the continual process of sensing, transmission and response to
									external mechanical stimuli of live cells–is essential for maintenance of normal
									cell, tissue, and organ functioning. Investigating mechanotransduction can bridge
									the gap between cellular mechanical behaviors and biochemical/morphological
									alterations and significantly advance studies in biomedical sciences and
									engineering, including the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases such as
									fibrosis, cancer initiation and metastasis. Despite the achievements in
									mechanotransduction studies including the identification of some of the key
									mechanosensors, the complex dynamics of cell internal structure (e.g., cytoskeleton)
									and how it responds to a myriad of physical/mechanical stimulus in affecting the
									inner workings of mechanotransduction have yet to be well characterized. Therefore,
									our goal is to build a suite of dynamics- and control-based tools to sense and model
									the cellular mechanotransduction dynamics and 3D dynamic structure in order to
									achieve cellular behavior manipulation. Specifically, data-driven and machine
									learning tools have been developed to address the modeling and control challenges
									raised by the complex behavior of cellular structure and nonlinear dynamics of the
									experimental mechanical characterization devices. In this talk, our recent
									achievements in cellular dynamic behavior studies, including deep learning-based
									cytoskeleton structure modeling and high precision control for cellular mechanical
									simulation will be presented.

								<p><strong>Bio-Inspired Variable Recruitment Fluidic Artificial Muscle Actuators:
										Innovations in Modeling, Configuration, and Control </strong></p>
								<p>Nicholas Mazzoleni, North Carolina State University</p>
								<p>Jeong Yong Kim, North Carolina State University </p>
								<p>Emily Duan, North Carolina State University </p>
								<p><strong>Matthew Bryant</strong>, North Carolina State University
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Human muscle tissues employ a massively over-actuated architecture in which many
									internal degrees of freedom (motor units, MUs) are used in parallel to produce a
									single output degree of freedom (muscle tissue contraction), through a hierarchical,
									load-adaptive control process called motor unit recruitment. This architecture
									allows natural muscle to achieve fast response and a wide gamut of force and
									compliance on demand, all while minimizing metabolic energy consumption. Through our
									work, we have sought to leverage the advantages of this adaptive actuation and
									control structure to improve the efficiency, bandwidth, stiffness control, and
									failure tolerance of hydraulic actuation systems for robots and human-assistive
									devices. In conventional hydraulic systems, energy loss occurs because the hydraulic
									cylinder actuators must be sized for the maximum force requirement of the system;
									operating in any submaximal condition means that pressure must be reduced (and
									energy shed as heat) by the control valves. We address this problem by replacing
									these actuators with fluidic artificial muscle (FAM) “tissues” that utilize a
									variable recruitment control strategy inspired by the MU recruitment behavior of
									natural muscles. These muscle tissues have the ability to dynamically adapt to
									different instantaneous loads by intelligently recruiting different numbers of
									actuator elements depending on the load, saving energy by reducing fluid consumption
									and minimizing throttling losses. Through a combination of actuator mechanics
									modeling, novel configuration and topology design, and hardware validation, we have
									created an analysis framework for variable recruitment FAM tissues that will allow
									for more sophisticated actuator designs and control architectures.

								<p><strong>What Can We Make Out of Control and Learning for Batteries and
										Electrification? </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Huazhen Fang</strong>, University of Kansas
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									We live at the dawn of an age of electrification and witness the power lithium-ion
									batteries in electrifying key sectors from transportation to renewable energy to
									grid infrastructure. However, while standing on their merits, lithium-ion batteries
									still face significant performance and safety concerns. This clouds the prospect of
									their role in future electrification. An urgent question thus is how to make
									batteries work better and live up to their potential. Control and learning theories
									have proven as a useful way to develop promising solutions in response to the
									question. In this talk, we will present our recent research at the intersections of
									these fields, supported in part by the NSF and especially the CAREER Program, and
									show our explorations on modeling, design, and control of safety-critical and
									high-performance battery systems. The topics will cover physics-informed machine
									learning for battery modeling, reconfigurable battery system design, and scalable
									control of large-size battery systems. We will further discuss prospective
									opportunities and challenges arising out of batteries and electrification.

								<p><strong>Simultaneous and Independent Control of Nanostructured Objects through the
										Use of Coupled External Electric Fields </strong></p>
								<p><strong>Kaiyan Yu</strong>, State University of New York at Binghamton
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Micro- and nanoparticles with functional components can be used in an extensive
									variety of applications, ranging from nanomanipulation to targeted drug delivery.
									The automated manipulation and assembly of micro- and nano-objects would vastly
									improve our ability to scale up the production of functional nanorobots, potentially
									revolutionizing small-scale manipulation and biosensing techniques in modern
									manufacturing, healthcare, and biology. The robust, efficient, and independent
									manipulation of multiple particles is limited by the global and coupled influence of
									wireless external fields. In this presentation, I will discuss our efforts in light
									of the aforementioned challenges to manipulate multiple micro- and nanoparticles
									independently and simultaneously using coupled actuation from global electric
									fields. I will first present the motion control and planning schemes to manipulate
									multiple micro- and nanowires that share global external electric fields in liquid
									suspension with a simple, generic set of electrodes. The proposed adaptive robust
									motion control has been proven to be stable for precisely driving various types of
									particles. The motion planning algorithms significantly reduce the computational
									complexity while maintaining suboptimal performance in both the travel time and
									distance. Next, the manipulation capability for the different numbers of objects
									will be analyzed. Finally, this talk will introduce the manipulation schemes with
									applications to functional nanodevice fabrication.

								<p>Special Session TuBT4, October 4, 14:00-15:30, America I & II
						
								</p>
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Over the past several years, manufacturers have faced a number of challenges, including shutdowns due to COVID-19, long lead times for raw materials, and labor shortages. Due to these challenges, manufacturers have constantly looked to improve their ability to address disruptions and disturbances, while reducing cost and maximizing quantity and quality. Companies have looked to integrate tools, methods, and algorithms from the recent explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities into their manufacturing systems. However, a number of challenges require researchers from different disciplines to work together to solve highly multidisciplinary problems. This session will provide an overview of the challenges in creating dynamic decision making and learning in the manufacturing system environment and identify research opportunities for control engineers in academia and industry to contribute to this area of research.
