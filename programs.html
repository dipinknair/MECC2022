									mechatronics.
									<br>
									In this talk, I would like to give a brief review of how this field has developed
									during the past
									fifty years and what my personal involvements have been in this field and what my
									current
									involvements are. Overall, the talk is a chronicle of my journey of exploration with
									my students in
									the forest of mechanical systems control.
								</p>

								<h1><span style="color: #535ba0">Bridging the Gap in Prediction, Estimation, and Control
										of Integrated Systems
									</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Jing Sun
								<p><strong>Date:</strong> Oct. 4th (Tuesday)
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Integrated systems are ubiquitous as more heterogeneous physical entities are
									combined to form functional platforms.
									New and “invisible” feedback loops and couplings are introduced with increased
									connectivity, leading to emerging
									dynamics and making the integrated systems more control-intensive. The
									multi-physics, multi-time scale, and
									distributed-actuation natures of integrated systems present new challenges for
									modeling and control. Understanding
									their operating environments, achieving sustained high performance, and
									incorporating rich but incomplete data also
									motivate the development of novel design tools and frameworks.
									<br>
									In this talk, I will use the integrated thermal and power management of connected
									and automated vehicles (CAVs) as
									an example to illustrate the challenges in the prediction, estimation, and control
									of integrated systems in the era
									of rapid advances in AI and data-driven control. While first-principle-based
									modeling is still essential in
									understanding and exploiting the underlying physics of the integrated systems,
									model-based control and optimization
									have to be used in a much richer context to deal with the emerging dynamics and
									inevitable uncertainties. For CAVs,
									we will show how model-based design, complemented by data-driven approaches, can
									lead to control and optimization
									solutions with a significant impact on energy efficiency and operational
									reliability, in addition to safety and
									accessibility.
								</p>

								<p><strong>Biography</strong>
									<br>
									Jing Sun received her Ph. D degree from the University of Southern California in
									1989 and her master's
									and bachelor's degrees from the University of Science and Technology of China in
									1984 and 1982, respectively.
									From 1989 to 1993, she was an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer
									Engineering Department at
									Wayne State University. She joined Ford Research Laboratory in 1993, where she
									worked on advanced powertrain
									system controls. After spending almost ten years in the industry, she returned to
									academia in 2003. She joined
									the University of Michigan, where she is the Michael G. Parsons Collegiate Professor
									in the Naval
									Architecture and Marine Engineering Department, with joint appointments in the
									Electrical Engineering and
									Computer Science Department and Mechanical Engineering Department at the same
									university. She holds 44 U.S.
									patents and has published over 300 archived journal and conference papers. She is a
									Fellow of NAI
									(the National Academy of Inventors), IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics
									Engineers), IFAC
									(International Federation of Automatic Control), and SNAME (the Society of Naval
									Architecture and Marine Engineering).
									She is a recipient of the 2003 IEEE Control System Technology Award.

								<h1><span style="color: #535ba0">“Mechanical Intelligence” in Robotic Manipulation: Good
										Design Makes Everything Easier
									</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Aaron Dollar
								<p><strong>Date:</strong> Oct. 5th (Wednesday)
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									The human hand is the pinnacle of dexterity – it has the ability to powerfully grasp
									a wide range of object
									sizes and shapes as well as delicately manipulate objects held within the
									fingertips. Current robotic
									and prosthetic systems, however, have only a fraction of that manual dexterity. My
									group attempts to
									address this gap in three main ways: examining the mechanics and design of effective
									hands, studying biological
									hand function as inspiration and performance benchmarking, and developing novel
									control approaches that
									accommodate task uncertainty. In terms of hand design, we strongly prioritize
									passive mechanics, including
									incorporating adaptive underactuated transmissions and carefully tuned compliance,
									and seek to maximize
									open-loop performance while minimizing complexity. In this talk, I will discuss how
									constraints imparted by
									external contacts in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion affect the mobility
									and control of the
									mechanism, introduce ways that these can be redressed through novel design
									approaches, and demonstrate
									how our group has been able to apply these concepts to produce simple and robust
									grasping and dexterous
									manipulation for tasks that are difficult or impossible to perform using traditional
									approaches.
								</p>

								<p><strong>Biography</strong>
									<br>
									Aaron Dollar is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science and
									Computer Science at Yale University.
									He earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Massachusetts at
									Amherst, a Ph.D. in Engineering
									Science at Harvard University, and was a postdoctoral associate at MIT in Health
									Sciences and Technology and the
									Media Lab. Prof. Dollar is the recipient of a number of awards, including young
									investigator awards from
									AFOSR, DARPA, NASA, and NSF, and is the founder of the IEEE Robotics and Automation
									Society Technical Committee
									on Mechanisms and Design. Aside from more than 200 peer-reviewed papers and
									mentoring over 40 PhD Students and
									Postdocs, his work has made an impact through the Yale OpenHand Project, the YCB
									manipulation benchmarking
