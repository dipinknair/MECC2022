								<h1><span style="color: #535ba0">Bridging the Gap in Prediction, Estimation, and Control of Integrated Systems
									</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Jing Sun
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Integrated systems are ubiquitous as more heterogeneous physical entities are combined to form functional platforms. 
									New and “invisible” feedback loops and couplings are introduced with increased connectivity, leading to emerging 
									dynamics and making the integrated systems more control-intensive. The multi-physics, multi-time scale, and 
									distributed-actuation natures of integrated systems present new challenges for modeling and control. Understanding 
									their operating environments, achieving sustained high performance, and incorporating rich but incomplete data also 
									motivate the development of novel design tools and frameworks.
									<br>
									In this talk, I will use the integrated thermal and power management of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) as 
									an example to illustrate the challenges in the prediction, estimation, and control of integrated systems in the era 
									of rapid advances in AI and data-driven control. While first-principle-based modeling is still essential in 
									understanding and exploiting the underlying physics of the integrated systems, model-based control and optimization 
									have to be used in a much richer context to deal with the emerging dynamics and inevitable uncertainties. For CAVs, 
									we will show how model-based design, complemented by data-driven approaches, can lead to control and optimization 
									solutions with a significant impact on energy efficiency and operational reliability, in addition to safety and 
									accessibility.

								<h1><span style="color: #535ba0">“Mechanical Intelligence” in Robotic Manipulation: Good Design Makes Everything Easier
									</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Aaron Dollar
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									The human hand is the pinnacle of dexterity – it has the ability to powerfully grasp a wide range of object 
									sizes and shapes as well as delicately manipulate objects held within the fingertips. Current robotic 
									and prosthetic systems, however, have only a fraction of that manual dexterity. My group attempts to 
									address this gap in three main ways: examining the mechanics and design of effective hands, studying biological 
									hand function as inspiration and performance benchmarking, and developing novel control approaches that 
									accommodate task uncertainty. In terms of hand design, we strongly prioritize passive mechanics, including 
									incorporating adaptive underactuated transmissions and carefully tuned compliance, and seek to maximize 
									open-loop performance while minimizing complexity. In this talk, I will discuss how constraints imparted by 
									external contacts in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion affect the mobility and control of the 
									mechanism, introduce ways that these can be redressed through novel design approaches, and demonstrate 
									how our group has been able to apply these concepts to produce simple and robust grasping and dexterous 
									manipulation for tasks that are difficult or impossible to perform using traditional approaches.

								<h1><span style="color: #535ba0">Nonlinear Observers and Everyday Applications in Motion
										Estimation</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Rajesh Rajamani
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									This talk presents recent results in nonlinear observer design and their
									applications in motion estimation problems ranging from wearable sensors to
									bicycles. First, a new observer design technique that integrates the classical
									high-gain observer with a novel LPV/LMI observer to provide significant advantages
									compared to both methods is presented. Second, the challenges in designing observers
									for nonlinear systems which are non-monotonic are discussed. Non-monotonic systems
									are commonly encountered, but popular observer design methods fail to yield feasible
									solutions for such systems. Hybrid observers with switched gains enable existing
									observer design methods to be utilized for these systems. Following the analytical
									observer results, some of their applications in motion estimation are presented,
									including a wearable device for Parkinson’s disease patients, a smart bicycle that
									automatically tracks the trajectories of nearby vehicles on the road to protect
									itself, and smart agricultural/construction vehicles that utilize inexpensive
									sensors for end-effector position estimation. Each application is accompanied by a
									video of a prototype experimental demonstration. One of these applications has been
									successfully commercialized through a start-up company which expects to sell over
									5,000 sensor boards this year.

								<h1><span style="color: #535ba0">Bridging the Gap: Using Real World Problems to Unveil
										Deep Control Principles</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Daniel Abramovitch
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									This talk is about the deep principles of control and system theory that one can
									uncover by working on practical control applications and physical, real-world
									problems. I want to convince you of something that you want to believe: that control
									and system theory are vital to the world at large and to the soon to be ubiquitous
									technologies of automated devices, vehicles, instruments, appliances, and our future
									robotic helpers. I also need to convince you of something most of us don’t want to
									believe: that we, the controls community, would vastly increase our influence on the
									world by refocusing our work as a framework that helps us build real-world systems
									rather than simply a mathematical exercise. We need to understand that for us to be
									the control engineers that the world needs, we must dramatically increase our
									outreach to practicing engineers and the general public.

									To make a case for how to do this, I will present examples of industrial problems
									that have led not only to new products, but to new understanding about deep control
									principles that were not readily apparent from the theoretical side of the gap. Such
									insights build bridges for us to add advanced methods to a much larger group of
									real-world control problems. Conversely, they also drive physical motivation and
									context for our theory. Not only do such problems allow us to improve the results of
									practicing engineers, but they allow us to familiarize the wider public with the
									fundamental principles of control and system theory and the underlying role that
									they play in many familiar technologies. The world continues to see dramatic
									increases in devices and services that are fundamentally dependent upon the
									principles of control and system theory. If we, the controls research community,
									want to take a leadership role in this technology globalization, we have some work
									to do.

								<h1><span style="color: #535ba0">Unlost in the Woods: Modeling Lost Person Behavior for
										Wilderness Search and Rescue</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Nicole Abaid
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Thousands of people are reported lost in the wilderness annually and locating these
									missing individuals as rapidly as possible depends on coordinated search and rescue
									(SAR) operations. As time passes, the search area grows, survival rate decreases,
									and searchers are faced with an increasingly daunting task of searching large areas
									quickly. To optimize the search process, mathematical models of lost person behavior
									can be used to inform current SAR practices. In this talk, we will learn about a
									family of agent-based models of lost person behavior which allow agents to move on
									known landscapes with a stochastic behavior profile. The behavior random variable
									selects from a distribution of known lost person reorientation strategies to
									simulate the agent’s trajectory. A range of possible behavior distributions are
									systematically simulated and a best-fit behavioral profile is found using data from
									the International Search and Rescue Incident Database. This work represents the
									first time-discrete model of lost person dynamics validated with data from real SAR
									incidents and has the potential to improve current methods for wilderness SAR.

										Across Different Time, Information, and Uncertainty Scales</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Iman Shames
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									In this talk we review recent advances in understanding the perception-
									action loops that underpin autonomy. This involves studying the
									perception, decision, and control subsystems that operate across
									different time, information, and uncertainty scales. In Daniel
									Kahneman's lexicon, these systems are labelled fast and slow. The slow
									systems are ponderous and resource exhaustive, the fast ones are fast,
									cheap, and prone to error. We discuss the steps taken to develop a
									formal rigorous design framework for autonomous systems that recognises
									situations when we are vulnerable to mistakes, potentially made by fast
									systems, and avoid large and catastrophic eventualities when the the
									stakes are high. This involves developing and using appropriate tools
									and applying engineering insight to obtain guarantees and certificates
									of performance that clearly describe the conditions where the system
									would behave in a desired way and what can go wrong when those
									conditions are not met while keeping the old proverb that "for example,
									is not proof" at the back of our minds throughout. The tools developed
									will be helpful to understand the behaviour of systems with many
									interacting subsystems that operate across different scales beyond
									autonomous systems.

								<h1><span style="color: #535ba0">Trust and Risk in Human-Autonomy Interaction: A Systems
										and Control Perspective</span></h1>
								<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dr. Yue Wang
								<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
									<br>
									Robots and autonomous systems are becoming an essential component that empowers
									economic and human possibility and will potentially change the future of work and
									life. The human-autonomy collaboration integrates the best part of human
									intelligence with the advantages of robotic systems. Beyond performance-centric
									design, human intent and intelligence may be encoded into robot decision-making,
									motion planning, and control to achieve safer and more reliable autonomy with higher
									user acceptance. However, the modeling and control of human-autonomy interaction
									systems, especially the social and cognitive aspects of human-robot interaction, is
									challenging and remains an active area. The talk will begin with an overview of
									research in human-autonomy interaction at the Interdisciplinary & Intelligent
									Research (I2R) lab in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University.
									The background and motivation of human-autonomy integration will be introduced. The
									focus will be on human trust in robots and human risk attitudes during
									decision-making under uncertainty. Computational trust and regret modeling work will
									be presented, followed by trust- and regret-based robot decision-making, control,
									and symbolic motion planning with humans-in-the-loop. Applications in the
									teleoperation of unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles,
									collaborative assembly in manufacturing, and autonomous driving will be discussed.
									The talk will conclude with a summary and a discussion about future research.
